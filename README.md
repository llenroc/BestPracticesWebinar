Xamarin Forms Best Practices Webinar

This was a webinar I created in the early days of Xamarin along with the help of Aaron Hill. I just couldn't delete this becaue it was one of my first customer webinars I created. 

Don't trust any of this code, it is from years ago. If anything, I think it provides a base template on how to evangelise a technical product. We had great success with this format.
